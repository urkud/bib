  abstract     = {Bifurcation theory and catastrophe theory are two of the best known areas within the field of dynamical systems. Both are studies of
                  smooth systems, focusing on properties that seem to be manifestly non-smooth. Bifurcation theory is concerned with the sudden
                  changes that occur in a system when one or more parameters are varied. Examples of such are familiar to students of differential
                  equations, from phase portraits. Moreover, understanding the bifurcations of the differential equations that describe real physical
                  systems provides important information about the behavior of the systems. Catastrophe theory became quite famous during the 1970's,
                  mostly because of the sensation caused by the usually less than rigorous applications of its principal ideas to "hot topics", such
                  as the characterization of personalities and the difference between a "genius" and a "maniac". Catastrophe theory is accurately
                  described as singularity theory and its (genuine) applications. The authors of this book, the first printing of which was published
                  as Volume 5 of the Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences, have given a masterly exposition of these two theories, with penetrating
                  insight.},

  abstract     = {This book is the first systematic presentation of the theory of random dynamical systems, i.e. of dynamical systems under the
                  influence of some kind of randomness. The theory comprises products of random mappings as well as random and stochastic differential
                  equations. The author's approach is based on Oseledets'multiplicative ergodic theorem for linear random systems, for which a
                  detailed proof is presented. This theorem provides us with a random substitute of linear algebra and hence can serve as the basis of
                  a local theory of nonlinear random systems. In particular, global and local random invariant manifolds are constructed and their
                  regularity is proved. Techniques for simplifying a system by random continuous or smooth coordinate tranformations are developed
                  (random Hartman-Grobman theorem, random normal forms). Qualitative changes in families of random systems (random bifurcation theory)
                  are also studied. A dynamical approach is proposed which is based on sign changes of Lyapunov exponents and which extends the
                  traditional phenomenological approach based on the Fokker-Planck equation. Numerous instructive examples are treated analytically or
                  numerically. The main intention is, however, to present a reliable and rather complete source of reference which lays the

                  stochastic flow on the projective bundle PM. Relative entropy is used to quantify the extent to which a measure fails to be
                  invariant under the flow. The results include the following. If M is compact and if the one-point motion on M is a non-degenerate
                  diffusion with stationary probability measure ϱ then λ1+...+λ d ≦0 with equality if and only if the flow preserves ϱ almost surely;
                  if in addition the induced one-point motion on PM satisfies a weak non-degeneracy condition then λ1=...=λ d if and only if there is
                  a smooth Riemannian structure on M with respect to which the flow is conformal almost surely.},

                  classification defined below has a numerical invariant that may take an arbitrary positive value. Here and below “families” are
                  “families of vector fields in the two-sphere”. This result disproves an Arnold’s conjecture of 1985. Then we construct an open set
                  of six parameter families whose moderate topological classification has a functional invariant. This invariant is an arbitrary germ
                  of a smooth map (R+,a)→(R+,b). More generally, for any positive integers d and d′, we construct an open set of families whose
                  topological classification has a germ of a smooth map R+d,a→R+d′,b as an invariant. Any smooth germ of this kind may be realized as
                  such an invariant. These results open a new perspective of the global bifurcation theory in the two sphere. This perspective is
                  discussed at the end of the paper.},

                  a functional space is quasiopen, if it may be obtained from an open set by removing a countable number of hypersurfaces. We prove
                  that there exists a quasiopen set in the space of boundary preserving diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold with boundary, such that
                  any map in this set has a thick attractor. The meaning of the word “attractor” should be specified. In the above claim an
                  “attractor” is, roughly speaking, a “topologically mixing maximal attractor”. We also conjecture that the claim is true for the
                  Milnor attractor of diffeomorphisms and prove the claim for Milnor attractors of mild skew products. We reduce the conjecture above
                  to a general conjecture about Milnor attractors of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.},

                  assumptions satisfied, in particular, in some $C^1$-open domain in the space of random dynamical systems.  It follows from this
                  theorem that the corresponding skew product has two invariant measurable sections, naturally called an attractor and a repeller.
                  Moreover, it turns out that convergence of orbits and the uniqueness of a stationary measure, phenomena that are mutually exclusive
                  in the case of a single map, typically coexist in random dynamical systems},

@INBOOK{KS,
  abstract     = {this paper we investigate generic two- and three-parameter smooth families of vector fields on the two-dimensional sphere. The
                  investigation is focused on determining the number of limit cycles which may appear in such families after small variations of the
                  parameters. In other words, we study bifurcations of limit cycles in generic few-parametric families of vector fields on the
                  sphere. It is known (see, for example, the introductory paper [8] in this Volume) that limit cycles are born from limit periodic
                  sets which are closed invariant subsets of the sphere, eventually containing arcs of nonisolated singularities of vector fields. But
                  since we study only generic families, with all singularities isolated, such limit periodic sets can be only polycycles (cyclically
                  ordered collections of singular points together with trajectories connecting them in the specified order; the precise definition is
                  given below). The question on the number of limit cycles which can be born from a polycycle occurring in a generic finite-parameter
                  family, is closely related to the Hilbert--Arnold problem [8]. In order to solve this problem, at least for two- and
                  three-parametric families, one needs to list all polycycles occurring in such families. This was our primary goal when writing this
                  paper.},

  abstract     = {In 1891, Poincaré started a series of three papers in which he tried to answer the following question (cf. [21–23]): “Is it possible
                  to decide if an algebraic differential equation in two variables is algebraically integrable?” (in the sense that it has a rational
                  first integral). More or less at the same time P. Painlevé asked the following question: “Is it possible to recognize the genus of
                  the general solution of an algebraic differential equation in two variables which has a rational first integral?”. In this paper we
                  give examples of one-parameter families which show that both problems have a negative answer. With some of the families we can also
                  answer a question posed by M. Brunella in [5].  En 1891, Poincaré commençait une série de trois articles dans lesquels il tentait de
                  répondre à la question suivante (cf. [21–23]) : « Est-il possible de décider si une équation différentielle algébrique en deux
                  variables est algébriquement intégrable ? » (au sens où il admet une intégrale première rationnelle). À peu près à la même époque,
                  P. Painlevé posait la question suivante : « Est-il possible de déterminer le genre de la solution générale d'une équation
                  différentielle algébrique en deux variables qui admet une intégrale première rationnelle ? ». Dans cet article, nous donnons des
                  exemples de familles à un paramètre qui montrent que les deux problèmes ont une réponse négative. À l'aide de certaines de ces
                  familles, nous pouvons également répondre à une question de M. Brunella dans [5].},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study random walks gn = f n−1 . . . f 0 on the group Homeo (S 1 ) of the homeomorphisms of the circle, where the
                  homeomorphisms f k are chosen randomly, independently, with respect to a same probability measure ν. We prove that under the only
                  condition that there is no probability measure invariant by ν-almost every homeomorphism, the random walk almost surely contracts
                  small intervals. It general- izes what has been known on this subject until now, since various conditions on ν were imposed in order
                  to get the phenomenon of contractions. Moreover, we obtain the sur- prising fact that the rate of contraction is exponential, even
                  in the lack of assumptions of smoothness on the f k ’s. We deduce various dynamical consequences on the random walk (gn ):
                  finiteness of ergodic stationary measures, distribution of the trajectories, asymp- totic law of the evaluations, etc. The proof of
                  the main result is based on a modification of the Ávila-Viana’s invariance principle, working for continuous cocycles on a space
                  fibred in circles.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider holomorphic foliations of degree two on the complex projective plane ${\mathbb P}^{2}$ having an invariant
                  line. In a suitable choice of affine coordinates, these foliations are induced by a quadratic vector field over the affine part in
                  such a way that the invariant line corresponds to the line at infinity. We say that two such foliations are topologically equivalent
                  provided there exists a homeomorphism of ${\mathbb P}^{2}$ which brings the leaves of one foliation onto the leaves of the other and
                  preserves orientation both on the ambient space and on the leaves. The main result of this paper is that in the generic case, two
                  such foliations may be topologically equivalent if and only if they are analytically equivalent. In fact, it is shown that the
                  analytic conjugacy class of the holonomy group of the invariant line is the modulus of both topological and analytic
                  classification. We obtain as a corollary that two generic orbitally topologically equivalent quadratic vector fields on ${\mathbb
                  C}^{2}$ must be orbitally affine equivalent. This result improves, in the case of quadratic foliations, a well-known result by
                  Ilyashenko that claims that two generic and topologically equivalent foliations with an invariant line at infinity are affine
                  equivalent, provided they are close enough in the space of foliations and the linking homeomorphism is close enough to the identity
                  map of ${\mathbb P}^{2}$.},
